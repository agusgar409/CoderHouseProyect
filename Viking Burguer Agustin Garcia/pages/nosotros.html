                Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about. 
                "Oh . . ." he said, the memory coming back to him at last.  "I dunno ... I never noticed it had gone.  I was more worried about my wand, wasn't I?" 
                They climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the Great Hall for lunch. 
                "Must be nice," Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings.  "To have so much money you don't notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing." 
                "Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!" s aid Harry impatiently.  "We all did, remember?"
