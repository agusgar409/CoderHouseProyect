                    Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about.

                    "Must be nice," Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings.  "To have so much money you don't notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing." 
                    "Listen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!" s aid Harry impatiently.  "We all did, remember?"
